# Implementation sequence and qualification

## Active execution

| Field | Selection |
| --- | --- |
| Scope | Make current-branch implementation, autonomous commits and efficient delivery explicit in the prepared GPT-6 Sol goal and workflow. |
| Phase | verification complete: current-branch/autonomous-commit policy and efficiency guidance reconciled and checked. Product runtime implementation and deployment await the maintainer's Goal activation. |
| Authority | Documentation edits and autonomous local commits on the current `main` branch. The future implementation Goal uses this same branch and autonomous commit policy; runtime implementation/deployment is not part of this preparation task. |
| Deliverables | Root [goal specification](../../GOAL.md), linked execution workflow, S0–S2 reading routes and [official source index](../development/external-sources.md); preserve the selected product scope and architecture. |
| Deployment premise | Principal services concentrated on one assessed host; the other primarily API and unrelated workloads. Account placement remains assessed. |
| Qualification | Current documentation-only policy changes passed local links/fragments/navigation checks for 160 Markdown files and diff review. The unchanged checker retains its prior nine-test result; no redundant suite rerun. Actual GPT-6 Sol Goal execution and product runtime qualification remain untested. |

Follow [execution workflow](execution-workflow.md). The user-selected design
supersedes single-database assumptions. Keep implementation and executed qualification
distinct. Documentation completion does not start runtime work automatically.

## Fast-start milestones

Deliver a small usable path before widening the product surface. These milestones
are dependency order and acceptance requirements, not reports of completed code.

| Milestone | Implement / execute | Exit evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S0 Graph substrate | Pinned Fuseki bundle, Java, one text-wrapped TDB2 dataset and persistent directories; follow [installation](../operations/installation.md). | Insert/read/text-match public fixture, graceful restart, backup and isolated restore; service remains private. |
| S1 Safe command foundation | Minimal Main HTTP adapter, Account verification, PostgreSQL Access, fixed model/shape artifact, guarded graph updates, immutable component revisions and polling outbox. | Same-head race has one winner; lost response reconciles its receipt; denied/invalid writes change nothing; old revision still resolves. |
| S2 First authenticated journey | Create metadata-only Work/MainVersion, publish one text contribution, assign different classification decisions in two Realms, search the eligible public view, then edit and read the prior revision. | Shared Work identity, distinct Realm decisions, exact comments, current authority and graph/text completeness remain correct end to end. |
| S3 Broaden to retained product gates | Add ratings, multilingual relevance, qualified private search, all indexing domains, sources and package flows through stages B–F below. | Owning capability and integration matrices pass for each activated surface. |

S0 can be followed from this documentation checkout; S1 and later require new
runtime code. S0 does not require a model compiler, Redis, a broker, a cluster,
full-corpus import or a billion-row benchmark. S1 can begin with a pinned authored
profile and generated or packaged validator artifacts; the reusable compiler grows
with admitted profiles rather than blocking the first command behind a universal
metamodel implementation. Public-only text is the first admitted search lane;
private text remains a required capability gated by scoped security qualification.

Fresh installation uses new datasets and explicitly seeded owners. No automatic
Fluree migration or dual-write mode is selected. If retained source data exists,
inventory it, export exact RDF/objects/revisions, convert to the new manifests and
verify identity, disclosure and restore before retiring the old copy. Do not infer
that TDB2 can recover missing historical content from a current-state RDF dump.

## Task reading routes

Start with the active scope above and the [coverage map](../architecture/coverage.md).
These routes select initial context; follow additional owning links when a change
affects their invariants. They do not redefine contracts or waive acceptance cases.

| Slice | Initial owners and realization | Exit evidence owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S0 Graph substrate | [Installation](../operations/installation.md), [Jena](../storage/jena.md), [recovery](../operations/recovery.md). | S0 above and [operations cases](../testing/operations.md): graph/text persistence, restart and isolated restore. |
| S1 Safe commands | [Commands](../contracts/commands.md), [identity/access](../contracts/identity-and-access.md), [model profiles](../contracts/model-profiles.md), [API/events](../implementation/api-and-events.md), [graph records](../implementation/graph-records.md), [model validation](../implementation/model-profile-validation.md), [authorization bridge](../implementation/authorization-bridge.md), [Access implementation](../implementation/access-control.md). | [Model](../testing/model-contracts.md), [IAM](../testing/identity-and-access.md) and [integration](../testing/backend-integration.md): admission, validation coverage, same-head races, idempotency, receipts, outbox and retained revisions. |
| S2 Authenticated journey | [Main Version](../contracts/main-version.md), [Space](../contracts/space.md), [classification](../contracts/classification.md), [search](../contracts/search.md), [vertical workflows](../implementation/vertical-workflows.md), [frontend](frontend.md). | [Native Work](../testing/native-work.md), [classification](../testing/classification.md), [search](../testing/search.md) and relevant [experience](../experience/README.md): one Work, two Realm decisions, eligible search and exact historical reads. |
| S3 Remaining capabilities | Select the next unmet dependency from stages A–G and [M01–M10](../product/capabilities.md#capability-coverage); use the corresponding [coverage row](../architecture/coverage.md). | Owning [backend](backend-acceptance.md), [frontend](frontend.md) and G1–G6 evidence for every retained capability. |

For each active slice, maintain its outcome, owner links, unresolved blocking
decisions, relevant acceptance IDs, executed evidence and next action in this
plan. Resolve the decisions needed for that slice before expanding speculative
design elsewhere. The [external source index](../development/external-sources.md)
supplies upstream lookup routes; supporting evidence stays beside its decision.
For a wording/link-only task, inspect the affected document and consumers without
activating runtime stages or loading all these routes.

## First-stage product and indexing scope

Space (Realm + Zone), contextual classification/ratings and REZICS Main Version
form the first foundation. Books, software, media, recipes, Skills and Prompts
exercise it. Universal package resolution/installation workflows are selected,
with Cargo, npm-family, Go, Nix, Minecraft and mod-provider profiles.

Collections, wikis, discussions, character/background/causal graphs and ordinary
interactions compose these foundations. [Capabilities](../product/capabilities.md)
retains the complete native product coverage. Provider limitations do not erase
native requirements. Full source-corpus indexing and separately operated hosting/
commerce/verification campaigns retain explicit rollout boundaries.

Stage A establishes typed authority composition and scoped institutional
representation. Stage F applies the [voting contract](../contracts/votes-and-references.md)
to institutional entitlements and approved collective decisions. Direct proxies
and explicit allocations are charter-enabled capabilities under that contract;
live proxy rerouting and full liquid delegation require a separate qualified
profile. Numeric Access work limits and 99% legitimate-task coverage remain
qualification targets in the [depth study](../research/access-depth-representation-and-voting.md).

Redis is outside the first release's delivery and acceptance scope. Likes and
favorites must work through Main's TDB2 authority without Redis. Redis deployment,
client integration, cache consumers and Redis-specific recovery/performance tests
belong to a later optimization scope; their absence does not block a first-release
gate. Existing correctness, bounded-query and practical-load obligations remain.

## Dependency order

The [repository organization proposal](../development/repository-structure.md)
defines the workspace layout and bootstrap preparation for these stages. It does
not change the selected owners or mark any runtime gate complete.

| Stage | Complete implementation scope | Exit evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Minimal identity/value profile, Fuseki guarded commands, immutable revisions, Context, Account/Access and local receipts; expand the IR as profiles grow. | Semantics, rejected states, retries and authority fences. |
| B | Space capabilities, concepts/expressions/applications, Realm fallback and rating contexts. | Two-Realms/one-resource journey with conflicting decisions and private data. |
| C | Work/Main Version, content/structure anchors, translations, Post chapters and fixed releases. | Stable common entry, precise history/comments and publication/adoption recovery. |
| D | Graph-integrated full-text/CJK, projections and all five native indexing domains. | Joint relation/text/context queries, completeness and bounded updates. |
| E | Live source conversion and universal package profiles, lock/install/update/rollback. | Current-source semantics, native-tool comparisons and interrupted operation recovery. |
| F | Remaining native interactions, governance, communication, export and admitted commercial applications. | Capability coverage and cross-owner workflows. |
| G | Deployment selection, installation, practical load and recovery on available hosts. | Measured bounded behavior, restore and explicitly accepted initial outage model. |

Dependencies permit independent work but do not excuse leaving one stage's required
behavior as a stub. Space/classification comes before treating Book or package
success as the whole product. Large-volume/fleet qualification is a later scale
stage, not a gate blocking this sequence.

## Acceptance gates

The [interaction/cache bootstrap](../implementation/interactions-and-cache.md)
provides a concrete Jena slice and later cache growth. Prior-engine probes are
historical research only; Jena, application, security and capacity gates remain pending.

[Backend scope](backend-acceptance.md) and [frontend acceptance](frontend.md)
detail the integration and experience obligations for these gates.

| Gate | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| G1 Design | Owners, state transitions, identities, authority, failures and required tests are specified. |
| G2 Persistence | Actual Jena/PostgreSQL/object bindings pass positive, rejected, concurrent and recovery cases. |
| G3 API | Stateful producer-to-consumer HTTP/SDK/MCP flows preserve the same contracts. |
| G4 Integration | Cross-owner source, publication, search, package and revocation journeys pass. |
| G5 Experience | Affected deterministic frontend checks and authorized scoped Storybook reviews pass. |
| G6 Operations | Fresh installation, backup restoration and measured practical workload meet elected objectives. |

## Delivery and qualification

The capability table is the scope denominator; this table is the single program
status owner. All product runtime qualification is pending until evidence from the new
architecture is produced. Do not insert historical implementation results here.

| Scope | Design | Runtime qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared architecture and selected technology | Jena startup boundary, TypeScript/Elysia 2/Bun, Yarn and vinext/Workers selected; owner protocols specified. | Framework fixture qualified only as recorded below; product S0–S3 pending. |
| Space, Context, classification and Main Version | Selected first-stage foundation. | Pending actual engine and end-to-end tests. |
| Five domains and universal packages | Selected with ecosystem profiles and live validation. | Pending conversion/resolver/install tests. |
| Security, operations and user experience | Specified owner protocols and acceptance. | Pending their respective gates. |

## Documentation verification

On 2026-09-24, goal preparation passed all nine documentation-tool regressions,
local links/fragments/navigation checks for 160 Markdown files and diff whitespace
review. The added regression checks links from the root goal file and navigation
through it. Eight upstream `llms.txt` indexes were fetched as recorded in the
[source index](../development/external-sources.md).

Source-level walkthroughs traced a substantive S1 command change through contract,
storage/authority and acceptance owners, an ordinary wording/link fix through its
local consumers without runtime activation, and continuation after S2 toward the
remaining capabilities. These inspect instruction consistency; no GPT-6 Sol Goal
run or measured agent-effectiveness comparison was performed. Runtime acceptance
remains pending until implementation executes its owning cases.

The preceding source-data reuse review completed documentation integrity and
source/diff review with all eight documentation-tool tests passing. Legal/provider
review supports the documented distinctions, not blanket clearance or § 512
eligibility; VNDB's data-license page was unavailable. Its substantive evidence
remains in the [source-data review](../research/source-data-rights.md). Runtime and
live-provider acceptance remain prospective.

On 2026-09-23, local link/fragment/navigation checks passed for 153 Markdown files;
all seven checker regression cases passed. Syntax-only checks with RDFLib 7.6.0,
Python JSON parsing and `sh -n` accepted eight SPARQL examples, twelve shell blocks,
three JSON blocks, two inline Turtle examples and the Fuseki assembler. Source/diff
review covered single-JVM ownership, conditional receipts, permanent revision
manifests, query scope, index deletion and restored epochs. Historical scripts and
recorded JSON evidence were preserved.

The subsequent application-stack reconciliation passed local documentation checks
for 157 Markdown files and all eight checker regressions. The new regression keeps
installed dependencies and disposable research output outside authored-document
navigation checks. The [framework probe](../../scripts/research/http_framework_comparison/README.md)
passed a Yarn 4.18 immutable install, TypeScript 7 fixture type checking and Bun
1.4.2 behavioral assertions against pinned Elysia 2 and Hono packages. Its
[result](../../scripts/research/http_framework_comparison/result.json) records
request/response validation differences and an Elysia OpenAPI configuration issue;
it does not certify the future product services. Diff whitespace checks passed.

These checks did not execute shell examples, start product Fuseki/Main/PostgreSQL, validate
assembler behavior, verify all external links or measure runtime/capacity. S0–S3
and runtime gates remain pending. [Development](../development/README.md) provides
the reproducible local integrity commands.

## Completion boundary

New-system integrity, source fidelity and recoverability are required. Old-system
schema/API/data compatibility and migration-only dual writes are not required.
Current-site inputs refresh each run; captures reproduce one run. Retain 500M/3B
planning arithmetic separately from measured initial-host acceptance.
