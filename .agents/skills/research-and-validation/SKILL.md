# Research and validation

For substantive decisions, proactively read applicable primary research, standards
and engineering implementations. Follow [task scope](../../../AGENTS.md#task-scope-and-evidence)
and the current program's [execution timing](../../../docs/plan/execution-workflow.md),
including for experiments and instruction evaluations.

## Frame the decision

Identify the intended outcome, actual constraints and uncertainties that could
change the choice. Inspect relevant local contracts and implementation as
evidence of present behavior, not proof of the best target design. Apply actual
compatibility requirements; do not invent them during a breaking redesign.

## Learn and propose

Select evidence for the question: standards and conceptual research for meaning,
original papers and implementations for mechanisms, and reproducible measurements
or operational reports for performance. Follow discovery pages to the primary
source. Check relevant dates, versions, assumptions and methods; distinguish a
proposal, prototype, vendor report and demonstrated deployment. Source prestige
and popularity do not establish applicability. No fixed source count or mix of
academic and engineering citations is required.

Compare credible alternatives and seek counterexamples or conflicting evidence
that could change the recommendation. Generate new designs or combinations when
useful; lack of an exact precedent is not grounds for rejection. Identify which
parts are sourced findings, your deductions or untested hypotheses. Explain why
the chosen combination fits the task rather than collecting supportive links
after choosing it. Reuse prior research when its assumptions still hold; refresh
the parts that could affect the decision.

## Match validation to claims

For consequential claims, identify what evidence could confirm or falsify them.
Apply this equally to established approaches and original proposals:

- Semantics and correctness: representative cases, invariants and counterexamples.
- State and authority: rejected operations, concurrency, revocation and recovery.
- Performance: explicit workload, distributions, topology and reproducible measurements.
- User experience: authorized observation of the actual output or interaction.

Choose checks proportionate to the uncertainty and consequence. A successful
component, external deployment or toy benchmark does not validate its composition
in this system. A planning estimate is not a measurement. In research-only work,
state the remaining validation and its decision criteria when experiments are
outside scope; hypotheses can remain proposals without being presented as facts.

When changing agent behavior or adapting models, use representative tasks to assess actual
decisions, unnecessary work and context cost. Include a relevant substantive
task and an ordinary task that should not activate the workflow. Structural
validation alone does not establish behavioral improvement.

## Retain useful evidence

Put direct source links, relevant dates/versions, selected lessons, tradeoffs,
validation results and remaining limits beside the decision in its owning
document or requested response. Match each citation to the claim it supports.
Keep unresolved research in its [research owner](../../../docs/research/README.md);
avoid duplicate decision records or mandatory reports for small tasks.

Continue while missing or contradictory evidence could materially change the
outcome. Otherwise deliver the recommendation and explicit remaining uncertainty.

The repository's [design evidence](../../../docs/architecture/evidence.md)
illustrates source applicability and qualification limits. Instruction design also
uses [OpenAI's scoped-skills guidance](https://developers.openai.com/blog/rethinking-skills-and-prompts-for-gpt-6-astra);
consult it for relevant behavior changes, not routine maintenance.
