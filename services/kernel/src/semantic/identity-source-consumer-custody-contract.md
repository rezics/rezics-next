# Account identity source consumer custody

`identity-source-consumer-custody.ts` owns the original Account identity source consumer
receipt. Its exported reference binds the exact receipt, accepted current job, original
native source component and digest, History barrier and erased logical field. Position
is bigint; original epoch is never replaced by the current owner epoch. This receipt is
neither permission nor a History artifact. Accounts owns the independent current erasure
root, original source minimization and all generated-copy associations and receipts.

## Native preparation

Verification resolves the actual `readAccountIdentityUndo` source and accepted job, including
after the account's terminal fence. Reversal reads its original Accounts source and calls
`lookupIdentityBinding` with that exact original input. Its prior `intent.undoJob` is never
used as the current job. Missing hints stay pending; preparation never admits or binds a new
receipt. Accepted claim key, digest, scope, sources, generation and binding transaction are
resolved from the actual native claim under its current owner. Logical requester and decider
are checked against the native source's actor and editor roles respectively; subject is the
source account. These names introduce no History role or permission.

The producer releases each home before probing job/control and the three fixed mapping,
Search and ALL Library receipts. It reconciles their exact native receipt, scope and complete
frontier through `identityEpochStore.reconcileStepReceipt`. Publication is a prerequisite,
never discharge. No point receiving record proves all receiving consumers have closed.

After releasing foreign checkouts, the original source home independently rechecks the source,
claim and current owner and commits one immutable **retained** obligation in
`semantic.identity_epoch_source_consumer_custody`. Its natural key is
`(partition_no,receipt_key,source_digest,barrier_account_id,barrier_version,barrier_at,erased_role,binding_generation)`.
`receipt_key` is the existing JSON `[kind,account,receipt]`. Native source epoch/position/
transaction, accepted job/epoch, scope and binding transaction are fixed columns, not JSON
evidence or new receiver UUIDs. No intent, reason, requester, decider or private payload is
mirrored. This is a custody receipt for the existing source, not another source registry.

The receipt is serialized through the real command executor and `erasure_source_commit`,
and enrolls all actual source roles with the existing Semantic native producer trigger and
locator plumbing. The default minimizer defers it: a retained receipt still has personal
locators and cannot acquire a retained-nonpersonal disposition or family acknowledgment.
This keeps the original source and surviving verification's undo/intent support pending.

## Terminal consumer composition

Source owns the terminal transition and local receipt. The original public reference,
read and verify signatures remain unchanged. The delivered
`identity-epoch-prearm-custody.ts` reader enumerates the retained admitted directory;
its opaque cut is verified before the final source command and is never persisted.
Library `readLibraryScopeEffectsPage` and `verifyLibraryScopeEffectsSeal` own expected
effects and their current seal. An unavailable implementation remains pending.

### Required bounded owner exchange

The following additive exports are required in the **original modules**. They are
requirements for owner delivery, not declarations of already implemented authority.
Types below are published by `identity-source-consumer-custody.ts`. No injectable
adapter or public proof setter is supported.

In `identity-epoch-binding.ts`:

```ts
readIdentitySourceConsumerWork(pool: Pool, reference: IdentitySourceConsumerReference,
  context: Readonly<{deadline: number}>): Promise<IdentitySourceConsumerWork | null>;
lockIdentitySourceConsumerCut(tx: CommandTransaction, reference: IdentitySourceConsumerReference,
  expected: IdentitySourceConsumerGeneration): Promise<IdentitySourceConsumerDisposition | null>;
verifyIdentitySourceConsumerCut(tx: CommandTransaction, reference: IdentitySourceConsumerReference,
  expected: IdentitySourceConsumerGeneration, disposition: IdentitySourceConsumerDisposition): Promise<boolean>;
```

`read` supplies an actual admitted native work reservation and native replay, undo
and restore generations; it performs no fresh identity admission. It must account for
its own failed/control work. The local `lock` resolves the exact original accepted
claim under the same binding lock used by admission/replay/undo/restore. It returns
discharged only after genuine native reversal and every surviving consumer is settled;
it returns transferred only when the immutable technical input remains indispensable.
Every later consumer must take that lock and consult Source's committed terminal row,
then use the native technical input or reject old-source use. A generation pre-read,
fixed publication state or current pending-job absence cannot implement this hook.
`verify` revalidates these native states in the caller's live original-home command,
including current owner/restore, without foreign I/O. It cannot accept caller stamps
as native truth. Existing readAccountIdentityUndo must use the genuine technical
source after transfer, retaining the original accepted job and input.

In `identity-scoped-observations.ts`:

```ts
readIdentityScopeConsumerWork(pool: Pool, ticket: IdentityPrearmTicketData,
  context: Readonly<{deadline: number}>): Promise<WorkAllowance | null>;
retainIdentityScopeConsumerFence(tx: CommandTransaction, ticket: IdentityPrearmTicketData,
  seal: LibraryScopeEffectSeal): Promise<boolean>;
```

`read` resolves the original retained registration/capture and its actual shared
Source reservation, including all failed/native/control work. It must not allocate
a guessed reservation or depend on query readiness. `retain` runs on the exact
Source home after Source has independently verified the current Library seal on
that same transaction. It rechecks the native registration/capture/attempt and
exhaustive current completion, records a durable native fence with real commit
provenance, and retains every proof obligation. Later scoped writers must extend
that durable obligation or reject old-source use; ordinary finish/revalidate and
a receipt read before release do not implement this guarantee. Unsupported public
catalogue and public-output sources remain separate pending branches.

In `access/agent-verification-identity.ts`:

```ts
acceptAccountIdentityTechnicalSource(tx: CommandTransaction,
  reference: IdentitySourceConsumerReference): Promise<boolean>;
verifyAccountIdentityTechnicalSource(tx: CommandTransaction,
  reference: IdentitySourceConsumerReference): Promise<boolean>;
```

These are same-original-home native receiving operations. Acceptance resolves the
actual original accepted immutable input and job and stores only indispensable
technical undo/replay identity, never reason/requester/decider/private payloads.
It enrolls all remaining personal locators through native all-role custody and
records real receiving commit provenance. The existing Accounts source/undo read
must resolve this native obligation after original source minimization, without an
active-account requirement or current-release reconstruction. Verify resolves and
locks that actual durable receiver in the same live command, with no foreign I/O.
Source's own receipt does not implement this receiver and cannot stand in for it.

These hooks are indispensable: the delivered directory proves inventory only,
the Library seal may be invalidated by a later writer, and current Accounts undo
reads still require the original source row. Their absence must leave the exact
branch pending. Source does not edit these owner modules or copy their SQL.

## Cost and evidence

Reads use released homes and fixed native source/claim/job keys. Directory pages
retain the native eight-scalar/2048-byte frontier and at most 100 RAW keys. Scope
pages share the actual Source work reservation; native and Library work units are
never converted. No caller scope list, expected-set mirror, zero from EOF, timing
shortcut or participant ACK is terminal authority. Account current root and all
History copy associations/receipts remain independently required.

Native tests are authored but deferred. Local typing is implementation evidence,
not native discharge, erasure or Goal completion.
