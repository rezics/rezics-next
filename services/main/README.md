# Main startup and current command boundary

Main runs on Bun 1.4.2 with pinned Elysia 2.0.0-beta.16. Yarn 4.18.0 owns
dependency resolution. The service factory is importable without starting
Fuseki; the process entry listens on loopback and requires a private Fuseki URL.

```sh
corepack yarn install --immutable
FUSEKI_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3030/rezics/ MAIN_PORT=3001 \
  corepack yarn main:dev
```

`GET /health/live` checks the process; `GET /health/ready` queries Fuseki and
returns 503 when it cannot reach the configured dataset. The service currently
exposes no product write route. `activateMetadataWork` is an internal graph
activation primitive; its admission is supplied by Access, never a request body.
Do not publish it until the claim/revocation fence and public command/error
contract are implemented.

The primitive validates a complete small Work/MainVersion candidate with the
[fixed profile](../../model/README.md), stages content-addressed immutable payloads
and manifests, then sends one conditional update through Fuseki's text wrapper.
The update writes current heads, revision anchors, an operation receipt, sequence
and outbox batch together. It looks up its own receipt after the update, including
after an ambiguous response. An unmatched guard stays pending; it is never treated
as success merely because Fuseki accepted the SPARQL request.

The first [Access migration](migrations/access/001_admission.sql) and
[`AccessAdmissionRegistry`](src/modules/access/admission.ts) use PostgreSQL 18
for a private principal/subject/representation/grant snapshot and a row-locked
scope gate. Registration commits its admission, receipt and outbox together.
Ordinary gate closure prevents later new admissions while earlier registered
operations retain a finite deadline. The internal
[`createAdmittedMetadataWork`](src/modules/work/create-admitted.ts) first verifies
Account's bearer assertion and scope, registers Access's principal, representation
and grant decision, then passes its admission ID, request digest, scope and epoch
to the guarded graph command. The graph receipt records that admission binding.
The live-Fuseki/PostgreSQL test seeds authority fixtures directly and uses a
fixture Account verifier; the separate Account test exercises the real issuer.
Claim/strong-revocation sealing, grant mutation commands and a combined
Account/Access/Fuseki HTTP journey remain required before exposing a product
operation. The gate-first lock order
must be preserved by later grant and representation mutations. PostgreSQL's
[transaction isolation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/transaction-iso.html)
and node-postgres's [single-client transaction rule](https://node-postgres.com/features/transactions)
inform this first binding.

To run the owner integration tests, provide PostgreSQL 18 binaries (`initdb`,
`pg_ctl`) and the extracted, checksum-verified Jena and Fuseki 6.2.0
distributions and Java 21 runtime:

```sh
export REZICS_FUSEKI_HOME=/absolute/path/to/apache-jena-fuseki-6.2.0
export REZICS_JENA_HOME=/absolute/path/to/apache-jena-6.2.0
export REZICS_JAVA_HOME=/absolute/path/to/java-21
corepack yarn main:typecheck
corepack yarn main:test
```

The test starts disposable Fuseki and PostgreSQL state in repository `.temp/`,
checks a network HTTP readiness response, graph/text bindings, retained object
bytes, receipt replay, conflicting keys, a lost response, a same-key race, stale
epoch rejection, an expired admission, an Access-registered Work command, denied
actor/assertion cases and the outbox count. [Executed JUnit evidence](tests/evidence/2026-09-24-main-storage.xml)
records the current run. These checks cover a storage sub-slice of SYS02/SYS10/SYS14
and a one-scope Access/graph binding; they do not establish strong revocation,
historical resolution, HTTP product commands or complete S1 acceptance. The [plan](../../docs/plan/README.md#active-execution)
owns current scope and next action.

The [Access test evidence](tests/evidence/2026-09-24-access-admission.xml) records
the local PostgreSQL register/replay/deny/closure checks, including a competing
registration and closure. It qualifies only the ordinary one-scope gate behavior;
the complete IAM07 and IAM10 outcomes remain pending.

The internal [`AccountAssertionVerifier`](src/modules/account/verify-assertion.ts)
requires a signed bearer JWT with the configured Account issuer, Main audience,
subject and expiry. It checks Account's current introspection result on every
admission and requires exact OAuth scopes. It returns only the verified
issuer/subject for Access's principal lookup; it does not accept a token-supplied
Access principal ID or public Agent. This first profile rejects DPoP assertions until
a shared cross-replica replay store is bound. Missing Account keys or current
enforcement fail closed. The authenticated command bridge is internal and still
needs a full claim/strong-revocation protocol. The [verifier evidence](tests/evidence/2026-09-24-account-assertion.xml)
uses a local test issuer and introspection server; the separate
[Account evidence](../account/tests/evidence/2026-09-24-account.xml) exercises
the real issuer and Main verifier together.
